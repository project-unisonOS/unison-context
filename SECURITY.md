# Security

Unison is designed as an edge-first system with explicit, auditable controls for any operation that leaves the device or touches sensitive data.

This repository is part of the UnisonOS project. For overall security guidance, including wake-word and “always-on” behavior, see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you believe you have found a security issue in this service, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub instead of filing a public issue.
